# PHP_MVC
This is a quick MVC demo code only. Not having all detailed coding.

to run this code, please install composer and phpunit. Use composer.json file to install all dependencies.

I have used phpunit with phpstorm editor first time. You need to configure phpstorm for phpunit if you directly want to run tests from editor.

I have previously configured phpunit in codeigniter.
